        This website is a product of the final assignment in the DTU course: 02806 Social Data Analysis and Visualization. The project deals with the fantasy book series “A Song of Ice and Fire” (by George RR Martin) which TV-show (Game of Thrones) has taken the world by storm. The primary dataset originates from Kaggle and consist of 38 battle/rows with 25 attributes for each. We match it with a dataset of the Game of Thrones map, which also includes information about landmark names, and which territories are claimed by who
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify">  
        The primary dataset is a collection of the battles from the first part of the series (a span of three years). It contains simple information like name, year, location, but also who attacks and defends, as well as the type and outcome of the battles.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify">  
        The dataset is small and incomplete, hence we will try to accommodate to our best abilities. Additionally, it has required some corrections of inaccurate values, which have also been pointed out in the Kaggle discussion forum.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify">        
        It should also be made clear that we obviously can’t do a typical social data analysis on the data, as the ground truth is inherently fictitious, and does not reflect anything from the real world. Despite this limitation, we will still have to imagine that it is true, and then reference the series as was it the real world.

      <h3> Evaluation of dataset </h3>
      <div align="justify">
      <p class="text-justify"> 
        The dataset enables the mapping of battles from Game of Thrones, enabling the visualization of the medieval fantasy world in a new light. The limitation of the dataset is its relatively small size. Additionally, it has required some corrections of inaccurate values and inclusion of NaN-values.
      </p>
      <p class="text-justify"> 
        We should also provide a disclaimer that we don’t work with “actual” social data, as this is a fictional universe. Instead, we will imagine that the series is still on-going, and we simply try to predict the outcome. We have a lot of information about the battles that might not be obvious when watching the series. Hopefully we can use these “facts” as a predictive factor, and not rely as much on classic story-telling tropes like “the underdog always getting on top” as so on.
